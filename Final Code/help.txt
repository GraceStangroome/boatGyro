"Hi there! Welcome to the help info screen for your vessles roll reducer. \n \nHaving persistant problems? Please call 03069 990 022. \n \nThe Start Program button starts the active fin moving and reducing the roll of your vessle. You can leave it running for however long you might need. \n \nThe Stop Program button stops the active fin from moving. \n \nView Reports shows you details about how the Fin has worked in the past. \n \nView Current Process shows you details about everything that has happened since you last pressed 'Start Process'. \n \nQuit closes the entire interface and program, which is good if the vessel won't be used for a period of time to reduce energy waste. You MUST press 'Stop Program' before quitting. \n \nNeed more help? Please call the number issued at the top of this message."
